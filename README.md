# Boris Bikes

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (that was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, came to us with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. This program emulates all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
